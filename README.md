# Canvas
Simple Code that intimates Paint Plus has some other extra features!!
And also, for seeing the output, Follow these steps:
1. Download the ZIP file to your download folder. I worked on one class only, that's why no packages or any sort of those things.
2. Unzip the ZIP file in your downloads folder. (Or anywhere you want, Just change the folder and path in cmd). Then go to cmd. (Not as admin) 
3. Type "cd downloads" without quotation marks (If path is set to C:\Users\<Your-UserName>\) 
4. Make sure you have at least Java SE 15 Installed.
5. Type "java Main.java" without quotation marks.
6. After few secs, a JFrame should appear. Try out all the features :D.
