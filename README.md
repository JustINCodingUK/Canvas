# Canvas
Simple Code that intimates Paint Plus has some other extra features!!
And also, for seeing the output, Follow these steps:
1. Download the Main.java file to your download folder. I worked on one class only, that's why no packages or any sort of those things.
2. Go to cmd
3. Type "cd downloads" without quotation marks (If path is set to C:\Users\<Your-UserName>\) 
4. Make sure you have at least Java SE 15 Installed.
5. Type "java Main.java" without quotation marks.
6. After 10 secs, a JFrame should appear. Try out all the features :D.
